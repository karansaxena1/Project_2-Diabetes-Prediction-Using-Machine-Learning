This project aims to develop a predictive machine learning model capable of accurately predicting diabetes in patients using machine learning techniques by analyzing a structured dataset.


## Dataset: 
The dataset used in this project consists of medical measures such as Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI (Body Mass Index), DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, Outcome

## Pre-processing: 
It primarily involves data cleaning and normalization technique.

## Model Development: 
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on the standardized dataset.

## Evaluation: 
Models have been validated based on the chosen metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Outcome: 
Accuracy score of the training data : 0.7866449511400652

Accuracy score of the test data : 0.7727272727272727
